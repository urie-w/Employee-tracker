# Employee Tracker

  ## Description
  This project creates a database. This database holds the data for all employees, roles, salaries, and departments that they work in. It also includes the managers. Users can update roles, view employees, salaries, roles, and finally save all the data on a database that can be pulled up anytime and saves all changes.

  ## Installation

After that you run npm run seeds once you have all your data inside of the seeds.sql file. Then you install all dependencies using npm i. Finally using npm start it will run the code the same way as demonstrated in the walkthrough video.
